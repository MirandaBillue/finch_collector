<h1>About FinchCollector!</h1>
<p>“Finch” is a loose term to describe one of many (hundreds!) 
    of small passerine birds. The finch species most commonly kept 
    as pets come from the Estrildidae family of finches, like the Gouldian finch. 
    Finches are ideal for those wanting a pet bird but not ready 
    to take on the demands of a parrot. -lafeber.com </p>
